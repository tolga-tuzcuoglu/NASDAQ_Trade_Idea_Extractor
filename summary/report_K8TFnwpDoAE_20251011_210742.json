Trading Ideas Mentioned\n\nThe speaker provides various trading ideas, often combining technical analysis with broader market sentiment.\n\n*   **General Market:**\n    *   Pullbacks in the overall market (NDX, S&P 500) are generally seen as buying opportunities.\n    *   Do not expect a strong spike in VIX unless NASDAQ sees a significant downturn.\n*   **Cryptocurrencies:**\n    *   **Bitcoin (BTC):** Expect consolidation after reaching all-time highs, followed by further upward movement. November is historically positive for Bitcoin.\n    *   **Ethereum (ETH):** After failing to break an interim resistance, expect consolidation and support finding, followed by an upward trend.\n*   **Individual Stocks:**\n    *   **MicroStrategy (MSTR):** Watch for support at the retested downtrend line; if it holds, an upward reversal is possible.\n    *   **Coinbase (COIN):** If it breaks above $388 resistance, it could quickly reach $430.\n    *   **Apple (AAPL):** A pullback to $250 is possible before a potential move to break the $260 resistance.\n    *   **NVIDIA (NVDA):** Expect continued upward movement after breaking $192, targeting a Fibonacci level around $197, then the psychological $200 mark.\n    *   **Amazon (AMZN):** Currently struggling to break above its 50-day/100-day moving averages; monitor closely as danger is not over.\n    *   **Google (GOOGL/GOOG):** Bull flag formation is still valid; a larger flag could be forming. The current pullback is not supported by high volume, suggesting major investors are not selling.\n    *   **Tesla (TSLA):** Bull flag formation, expects to reach $488.\n    *   **AMD (AMD):** After a sharp rise, expect a period of consolidation (rest) for a few days before further moves towards $250 and then $300 (mid-long term).\n    *   **Palantir (PLTR):** Strong, watch $190 resistance.\n    *   **CrowdStrike (CRWD):** Resistance at $518, support adjusted to $476.\n    *   **Broadcom (AVGO):** Continues to be suitable for swing trading opportunities.\n    *   **Inmode (INMD):** If it closes above $59 resistance, it could quickly move to $64.\n    *   **SoFi (SOFI):** Swing trade attempt worked, strong, expects to see $30 again.\n    *   **AppLovin (APP):** Due to an investigation, a pullback to $475 is possible. Exercise caution.\n    *   **Rocket Lab (RKLB):** Has seen significant gains (50% in a week from $45 to $68). Currently at a major resistance level ($68); caution is advised, and taking profits on short-term/risky positions might be a good idea.\n    *   **EOS:** Has passed $13.30 and is heading towards $20. However, technical indicators are overbought; keep stop-loss levels tight if buying now.\n    *   **Constellation Energy (CEG):** First target $403, then $470.\n    *   **Axon Enterprise (AXON):** Potential buying opportunity around current levels or if it pulls back to $642 (long-term perspective).\n    *   **UnitedHealth (UNH):** Gap filled at $376; if it breaks above $376, a move towards the $500 long-term target is expected.\n    *   **Eli Lilly (LLY):** Stuck at an interim resistance of $858; if it breaks, $902 is next. Exercise caution.\n    *   **Arista Networks (ANET):** Swing trade opportunity after breaking out of a triangle formation (already yielded ~10% gain). Heading towards $179 (Fibonacci golden ratio).\n    *   **Arista Labs (ARIS):** Broke its downtrend, expected to move towards $262.\n    *   **Salesforce (CRM):** Has not broken its downtrend yet, but the price is tightening, suggesting a breakout is approaching.\n    *   **Sea Limited (SE):** Broke its downtrend, then retested it. Monitor for a fake breakout (if it falls back below). Long-term positive.\n    *   **Grab Holdings (GRAB):** Swing trade opportunity that generated good returns. Long-term positive.\n    *   **Celestica (CLS):** Strong graph, potential for a swing trade, expecting $283 (12% upside).\n    *   **Enphase (ENPH):** Forming a bull flag similar to a previous pattern; if it breaks upward, $130s, then $150.\n    *   **Credo (CRDO):** Bear flag formation is a risk, but it found support at the 50-day moving average. Monitor if it stays above the 50-day MA for continued uptrend.\n    *   **Oscar Health (OSCR):** Positive news expected, anticipates reaching $30.\n    *   **Tempus (TEM):** Reached $102, expects $109 (Fibonacci level). Caution at $109 due to resistance. It's a risky, volatile, and unprofitable company.\n    *   **Duolingo (DUOL):** Broke previous high and 50-day MA, signaling an uptrend. If it breaks the 100-day MA ($350), it could move towards $400+.\n    *   **Marvell (MRVL):** Uptrend continues, expects $96 (Fibonacci level).\n    *   **Micron (MU):** No deterioration in trend, expects $216.\n    *   **Iris Energy (IREN):** Strong performance (47% up in 10 days from $45). Next Fibonacci target $74 (potential 72% total gain in ~2 weeks).\n    *   **Trade Desk (TTD):** Showed a bottoming-out pattern and gained 15% from $46. Currently stuck at the 50-day MA, but still potential for further upside.\n    *   **Li Auto (LI):** Uptrend continues, expects $430.\n    *   **BMN (Potential proxy for Bitmain or similar crypto-related stock):** Triangle breakout was a fakeout, further exacerbated by Ethereum's pullback and a short-seller report. A pullback to the 50-day MA ($49) is possible.\n    *   **CoreWeave (CORE):** Very strong chart, uptrend continues. Mid-long term target $187. Interim resistance at $148 might be hard to break.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Stock Symbols/Tickers Discussed\n\nThe following stock symbols/tickers were mentioned in the transcript.

Market Analysis Points\n\nThe speaker offers a mix of macro and micro observations:\n\n*   **Macro/General Market:**\n    *   Powell's recent speech had minimal impact on the market.\n    *   NASDAQ (NDX) showed a very slight pullback (less than 0.10%), considered normal, with a tendency to recover by market close.\n    *   Market is generally near resistance levels, and slight negative divergences could indicate short-term pressure.\n    *   Pullbacks are frequently viewed as buying opportunities.\n    *   VIX is expected to remain subdued unless NASDAQ experiences a significant decline, suggesting a relatively stable or slightly upward market.\n    *   Concerns about the economy and market are generally mild.\n*   **Cryptocurrency Market:**\n    *   Bitcoin is consolidating after reaching an all-time high, with a potential for sideways movement before another upward leg. November is highlighted as a historically positive month for Bitcoin.\n    *   Ethereum shows similar consolidation after failing to break a resistance level.\n*   **Stock-Specific Observations:**\n    *   MicroStrategy (MSTR) faces selling pressure from Michael Saylor's ATM sales, causing pullbacks.\n    *   NVIDIA (NVDA) is rising due to US approval for chip sales to UAE (Abu Dhabi, Dubai).\n    *   Google's (GOOGL) recent pullback lacks significant trading volume, indicating that \"big whales\" are not participating in the selling, which could be a positive sign.\n    *   AMD (AMD) has risen sharply and is due for a consolidation period.\n    *   AppLovin (APP) is pulling back due to an ongoing SEC investigation.\n    *   Rocket Lab (RKLB) has seen a very rapid, significant increase in a short period.\n    *   EOS is showing overbought technical indicators.\n    *   Constellation Energy (CEG) benefits from America's energy needs.\n    *   Tempus (TEM) is noted as a risky, volatile, and unprofitable company.\n    *   BMN (if a crypto-related stock) faced a fake breakout due to Ethereum's pullback and a negative short-seller report.\n\n---\n\n### 4.
