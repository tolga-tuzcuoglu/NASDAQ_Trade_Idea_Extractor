### 3. Market Analysis Points

*   **General Market (NASDAQ & S&P 500):**
    *   Powell's recent speech offered no new insights.
    *   Currently experiencing a very slight pullback (less than 0.10%), which is considered normal.
    *   Markets are generally expected to recover by close.
    *   Near resistance levels, potential for minor, short-term pullbacks.
    *   These pullbacks are often seen as buying opportunities.
*   **Volatility (VIX):**
    *   VIX is repeatedly pulling back from its 100-day moving average.
    *   If the NASDAQ does not experience a significant drop, a strong spike in VIX is not expected.
*   **Cryptocurrency Market:**
    *   **Bitcoin:** Recently hit an all-time high ($126,000), now in a consolidation phase (sideways movement). Expected to rise again; March and April are historically positive months.
    *   **Ethereum:** Rose but failed to break an intermediate resistance, currently pulling back. Expected to find support, consolidate, and then move higher.
*   **Specific Stock Themes:**
    *   **AI/Semiconductors:** NVIDIA's rise due to relaxed chip export restrictions (UAE), AMD's strength, Microsoft's bull flag.
    *   **Energy Sector:** Constellation Energy remains positive due to America's energy needs.
    *   **Cryptocurrency-Related Stocks:** MicroStrategy showing weakness due to ATM sales by Saylor when prices rise, Coinbase showing relative strength despite MSTR's pullback.
    *   **Bullish Formations:** Many stocks are forming bull flags (Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Envista Holdings), indicating potential for further upside after consolidation.
    *   **Low Volume Pullbacks:** Google's pullback is on low volume, suggesting major investors ("whales") are not selling, which is a positive sign.
    *   **Risks:** AppLovin facing SEC investigation, Tempus being a risky, volatile, and unprofitable company.

### 4. Investment Recommendations

    *   **Axon Enterprise (AXON):** Recommended for long-term hold, with specific buy levels mentioned.

    *   **LEU (Unclear Ticker):** Strong uptrend, expected to continue.
*   **Take Profit / Exercise Caution:**
    *   **Rocket Lab (RKLB):** At significant resistance ($68), consider taking profits on short-term or risky positions.
    *   **EOS (Crypto):** Overbought, keep stop-loss levels close.
    *   **Tempus (Unclear Ticker):** Extremely risky and volatile, approaching resistance, caution advised.
    *   **Eli Lilly (LLY):** Caution advised as it approaches $858 intermediate resistance.
    *   **Celsus (Unclear Ticker):** If held for swing trade, profit-taking recommended after reaching target.
*   **Negative/Unfavorable Outlook:**
    *   **Meta Platforms (META):** No positive change observed.
    *   **AppLovin (APP):** Pullback expected to continue due to SEC investigation, caution advised.
    *   **BMN Arda (Unclear Ticker):** Pulled back due to a negative report from a short seller; potential further pullback to $49 (50-day MA).
